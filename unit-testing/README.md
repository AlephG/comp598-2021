# Collecting, Cleaning and Testing
The goal of this project was to explore further data cleaning using Python and develop good unit testing habits to standardize, modularize and ensure robustness of code.

## Setup
Clone the repo.

## Running

Run `python3 src/clean.py -i <input_file> -o <output_file>` with `data/example.json` as input.

Run `python3 -m unittest` to test the `src/clean.py` script.
